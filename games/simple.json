    "instructions": "Rock–paper–scissors or Scissor-Paper-Rock, is a zero-sum hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are 'rock' (✊ a simple fist), 'paper' (✋ a flat hand), and 'scissors' (✌️ a fist with the index and middle fingers together forming a V). The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ('rock crushes scissors') but will lose to one who has played paper ('paper covers rock'); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ('scissors cut paper'). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is immediately replayed to break the tie. - Rock–paper–scissors. (2017, March 10). In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.

    "instructions": "Players of one team sit in the cross. Play four rounds (16 games). Add the value of all players of one team. The team with the greater total wins. If there are more than four players dealing rotates among all players and the four player after the dealer (dealer not included) play this round. But there have to be two players from each team at all times. So after two players from one team more players from the same team are skipped."
